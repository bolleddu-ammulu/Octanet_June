To-Do-List Project:


Here is the some information about my project which was developed by using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

The To-Do list application is a simple and interactive web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently.Leveraging my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I focused on creating a seamless user experience.This included implementing features like task categorization, prioritization, and real-time updates. It consists of an HTML structure that provides the basic layout, a CSS stylesheet that enhances the visual appeal, and JavaScript code that adds interactivity and data persistence.
The HTML includes a container that centers the content, a header with the title and an icon, an input field for entering tasks, a button to add tasks, and a list that displays the tasks.
The CSS applies global styles, styles the container with a gradient background and shadow effects, and ensures the input field, button, and list items are visually appealing and user-friendly. 
Transitions and hover effects are added to enhance the user experience, making the interface responsive and interactive. 
The JavaScript handles the core functionality: adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, and saving the task list to local storage to ensure data persistence across sessions.
When a user enters a task and clicks the "Add Task" button, the task is added to the list and saved in local storage. 
Clicking on a task toggles its completion state, while clicking the delete button removes the task. The application retrieves and displays the saved tasks from local storage whenever the page is reloaded, providing a seamless and consistent user experience.
Overall, the To-Do list application combines a clean design with practical functionality to help users keep track of their tasks effectively.
